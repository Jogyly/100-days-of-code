**About me**: Hi, my name is Max! I'm realy happy if smbdy read this :) Sry for my English I' not so good in English)
So I want to do my program that can make simple things. This is tree of characters for my little book. My program must to do:
<ol>
  <li>Upload data from json</li>
  <li>Show tree</li>
  <li>Open node</li>
  <li>Edit node</li>
  <li>Add node</li>
  <li>Save node</li>
  <li>Save tree to json</li>
</ol>

Easy peasy :) But I don't want to do without motivation and I desided to start my #100DaysOfCode Challenge!)
Aaaand... I've already make 1-3 items from my list) When I finish this I'll start new project.

My project has name Just Another and will be in this repo.

<ul>
 <li>React</li>
 <li>MobX</li>
 <li>Two left hands :D</li>
</ul>

This is my mini tree:

### Day 1: Jan 09, 2019

I know MobX so bad and can't understand why some changes save but other changes don't save -_-
I reread documentation and read this article: https://medium.com/dailyjs/mobx-react-best-practices-17e01cec4140
Hope this help me...

### Day 2: Jan 10, 2019

I decided to refactor all my project and add normal babel and support decorations. I've made this but not all complete.
